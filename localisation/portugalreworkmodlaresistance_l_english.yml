portugalreworkmodlaresistance.1.desc:0 "Our plea for help to reorganize our army has not been heard by many European Nations, with only Denmark, the Netherlands, and Portugal responding. The most promising out of these candidates is Portugal, and while they may not be a world power, their army is still far more westernized than ours. Their only condition is that we transfer the city of Qingdao to them, but we really could use all the help we can get..."

portugalreworkmodlaresistance.11.desc:0 "While talks of an Iberian Union have failed in the past, the current state of the world may be conducive to such a proposal.

However, should we unify, we may be able to bounce back from this recession and come back stronger than ever!"

portugalreworkmodlaresistance.14.desc:0 "The Portuguese population is in favour of having their own king, Dom Duarte Nuno, lead the newly united Iberian Kingdom. However, the Spanish wish to have their own king, Alfonso XIII, lead the country instead. It would be prudent to hold a national referendum between the two countries, and see which of the two is far more popular..."

As a result of Alfonso XIII's passing, Dom Duarte Nuno will take his place. All close friends, family, world leaders, are invited to the private funeral. The Public funeral is scheduled to occur on the 17th of March."
