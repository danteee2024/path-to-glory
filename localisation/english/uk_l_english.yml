 britain.28.t:0 "Reorganization of Africa"
 britain.28.desc:0 "Africa has been under our dominion for many years. It is time we allow them to self-rule, however we are confronted with the question of how they will be organized. We have two options, allow the nations be formed on ethnicity or confederate the colonies together based on geographical significance."
 britain.28.a:0 "Release Nations based on Ethnicity"
 britain.28.b:0 "Confederate the Colonies"
 
 britain.29.t:0 "Ressurgence of the Angevin Empire"
 britain.29.desc:0 "Asserting rightful claims to territories once under Angevin rule, particularly in France, British forces launch a decisive offensive, swiftly securing key regions. This bold endeavor symbolizes a triumphant resurgence of British power and influence on the European stage. Drawing upon historical ties and strategic vision, the UK reaffirms its role as a dominant force in shaping the continent's destiny.\n\nWhile some may view our actions with skepticism, we stand unwavering in our commitment to reclaiming our rightful place in history. The recreation of the Angevin Empire heralds a new chapter of strength and leadership for the United Kingdom, ensuring our enduring presence in the annals of time."
 britain.29.a:0 "Dieu et mon droit."

 britain.30.t:0 "Edward VII, King of England and France"
 britain.30.desc:0 "Edward VIII of House Windsor, inexperienced upon taking the throne, has now surpassed expectations. He has proclaimed himself a new title; King of France with his other titles, King of the United Kingdom and Dominions of the British Empire, and Emperor of India. The French have not been under English control since the House of Plantagenet during the 12th and 13th century. Where will this newfound confidence in our King lead us now?"
 britain.30.a:0 "Rex Angliae e Gaule Dei Gratia"
 
 britain.31.t:0 "Our Royal Roots"
 britain.31.desc:0 "Our magnanimous monarch can trace his family roots to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha takes its name from its oldest domain, the Ernestine duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and its members later sat on the thrones of Belgium, Bulgaria, Portugal, and our United Kingdom.\n\nWe stand with a duty to restore our fallen royal family's kingdoms. We march on Belgium, Bulgaria, and Portugal, reclaiming our family's former glory. Let us rise, united, for our ancestors and our homeland's honor!"
 britain.31.a:0 "Cowards never won heaven."
 
 britain.32.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 britain.32.desc:0 "Historically, the Plantagenets, founders of the Angevin Empire of old, held court primarily on the continent at Angers in Anjou, and at Chinon in Touraine. We have some in our court which would like to entertain the idea of moving our capital to this location. This would certainly come to have its own host of benefits and detriments. What shall we do?"
 britain.32.a:0 "London is the seat of our Empire."
 britain.32.b:0 "Let us continue to follow in the footsteps of our predecessors."
 
 britain.33.t:0 "Brazil, A New British Colony"
 britain.33.desc:0 "Brazil was historically a Portuguese colony and since its independence, it has been unstable and in need of new rule. We have returned order to the land and we believe that Brazil needs a new identity as a Dominion of our great Imperial Federation."
 britain.33.a:0 "We welcome Brazil!"
 
 britain.34.t:0 "The Question of Parliament"
 britain.34.desc:0 "The House of Commons, our democratically elected house of Parliament, is where a majority of laws must pass through. Our Majesty, in his excellence, has taken the throne and returned power to it. Should our parliament be realigned to fit this new situation or allowed to continue as-is?"
 britain.34.a:0 "We shall replace the members of Parliament."
 britain.34.b:0 "We will let it be."
 
 britain.35.t:0 "Family Ties: Belgium"
 britain.35.desc:0 "Leopold III belongs to the house 'of Belgium'. This royal house was changed from the original title 'Saxe-Coburg-Gotha' which our own house, 'Windsor' is also derived from. Leopold, and the Belgian throne, have never been in control, chained down by a constitution. It is time we put in place an monarchy with unshackled power under Leopold III."
 britain.35.a:0 "Let us put Leopold III on the throne."
 
 britain.36.t:0 "Family Ties: Portugal"
 britain.36.desc:0 "Dom Duarte Nuno belongs to the house 'Bragança'. This royal house was changed from the original title 'Saxe-Coburg-Gotha' which our own house, 'Windsor' is also derived from. Dom Duarte Nuno, and the Portuguese throne, have never been in control, chained down by a constitution. It is time we put in place an monarchy with unshackled power under Dom Duarte Nuno."
 britain.36.a:0 "Let us put Dom Duarte Nuno on the throne."
 
 britain.37.t:0 "Family Ties: Bulgaria"
 britain.37.desc:0 "Tsar Ferdinand I belongs to the house 'Battenberg'. This royal house was changed from the original title 'Saxe-Coburg-Gotha' which our own house, 'Windsor' is also derived from. Tsar Ferdinand I, while he is infamous for his actions during and prior to the Great War, we should put him back into power."
 britain.37.a:0 "Let us put Tsar Ferdinand I on the throne."
 
 britain.38.t:0 "Last Resort: Franco-British Union"
 britain.38.desc:0 "Reynaud supporter Charles de Gaulle had arrived in London earlier today and Monnet told him about the proposed Franco-British union. De Gaulle is trying to convince Churchill that some dramatic move is essential to give Reynaud the support which he needs to keep his Government in the war. De Gaulle called Reynaud and told him that the British prime minister proposed a union between their countries, an idea which Reynaud immediately supported.\n\nDe Gaulle, Monnet, Vansittart, and Pleven quickly agreed to the document proclaiming a joint citizenship, foreign trade, currency, war cabinet, and military command. Churchill withdrew the armistice approval, and at 3 p.m. the War Cabinet is meeting again to consider the union document. Despite the radical nature of the proposal, Churchill and the ministers recognize the need for a dramatic act to encourage the French and reinforce Reynaud's support within his cabinet.\n\nOther French leaders are less enthusiastic."
 britain.38.a:0 "We shall be one nation!"
 britain.38.b:0 "This is a poor idea."
 
 britain.news.1.t:0 "The Franco-British Union"
 britain.news.1.desc:0 "'France and Great Britain shall no longer be two nations, but one Franco-British Union. The constitution of the Union will provide for joint organs of defence, foreign, financial and economic policies. Every citizen of France will enjoy immediately citizenship of Great Britain, every British subject will become a citizen of France.'\n\n--Declaration of Union, approved by the British War Cabinet"
 britain.news.1.a:0 "We can only wonder what this means."

 britain.39.desc:0 "As we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our Allied partners in the ongoing struggle against Axis aggression, it is imperative to convene at the Cairo Conference to reinforce our collective commitment to victory and lay the groundwork for a stable and just post-war world order. The Cairo Conference will enforce the importance of unity, strategic coordination, and principled diplomacy.\n\nThe Cairo Conference presents a critical opportunity for us to assert our leadership, promote Allied cooperation, and shape the course of history in favor of peace, freedom, and justice.

They seek to foster collaboration among Allied powers in confronting the challenges posed by Axis aggression and shaping the future course of the war. Through open dialogue and mutual cooperation, they aim to strengthen the bonds of unity and solidarity that underpin our shared commitment to victory and the principles of freedom, democracy, and human dignity.\n\nShould we meet with the British in Cairo?"
