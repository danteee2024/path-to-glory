 page1_poet_loc: "Raise the blackened banner; though sirens wail and skies are torn by flame,\nWe do not yield, nor shall we kneel, though thunder shakes our name.\nEach cratered road, each burning field still beats a heart of steel;\nThis soil is ours; and we alone decide the fate we seal.\n\nLook not with pity, O pale and foreign sun!\nShine instead on men who'd rather die than run!\nFor every shattered rifle, a thousand more shall rise;\nFreedom is not begged for it is taken with clenched eyes.\n\nWe were born from fire and from fire we remain,\nNo tyrant’s boot shall mark this land with shame.\nLet rivers flood and empires scream,\nWe march through ash, and we still dare to dream!"
